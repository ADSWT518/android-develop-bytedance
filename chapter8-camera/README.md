## What I have done

All basic functions are implemented.

* Customize the name of the saved file.

* Sow the information of the latest saved file.

* Support camera filp.

* Multi-function button: click to take a picture, long press to take a video, long press to release to end the shooting.

## Unsolved problem

* The rotation angle of the saved picture or video is not correct.
